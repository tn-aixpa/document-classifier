# Document-Classifier
A generic LLM-based document classifier

#### AIxPA

-   `kind`: product-template
-   `ai`: NLP
-   `domain`: PA

Multiclass sequence classifier based on BERT base italian, fine-tuned on selected corpora from Municipalities and organizations. 
The classifier is trained to suggest one or more labels from the taxonomy needed to categorize Family Audit plans in use by Municipalities and organizations involved. 
When given a title, a description and an objective the classifier can predict the appropriate label from the taxonomy in use. 
The model can be trained for further fine-tuning on new data. 

## Usage
The usage for this template is to facilitate the integration of AI in two PA-user interfaces:

- PA operators (from municipalities, regional operators, etc.)
- Organization operators

More details in the usage section [here](./docs/howto).
